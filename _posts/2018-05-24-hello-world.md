I'm beginning this blog after a long night of thinking. 

Yesterday, a job where I applied rejected my application after a first interview that didn't go well. I was so stressed that my capacity of thinking and speaking in a correct English was completely broken. I couldn't even respond to simple questions about security.

However, they said that I was a super cool candidate and completely in their company's mindset so I keep that going.

After explaining what went wrong with my interview, they said that the door was still open and that I should try again in a year.



This blog will have multiple purposes for me : 
- **Practice my english** : Since it's not my native language, it's not the one I know the most. I hope that writing and explaining stuffs in english will help.
- **Learn stuffs** : There is a strong difference between learning by reading and learning by explaining something to someone else. To explain something to someone else you need to have a more in-depth knowledge of that thing. Hopefully, this will help me explaining security concepts that are not completely clear in my head for the moment.
- **Keep good notes** : When I do something, I do not take good notes and I end up losing them. This blog will gather notes of topics that I learn, write-ups that I do, etc. In this way I hope to be more organised and keep better notes, all in one place.
- **Be prepared to take that interview again in a year** : Let's see where this will get me.

I will soon add a comment section under the articles in case someone will accidentally end up here :D.
